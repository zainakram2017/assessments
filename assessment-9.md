# Assessment-9

Type the following program in your editor and observe the results:

```javascript
let x, y;
for (x = 0; x < 5; x++) {
    for (y = 1; y <= 5; y++) {
        console.log(x.toString() + y.toString());
    }
    console.log();
}
```

## Task-08

Write a program to compute sinx for given x. The user should supply x and a positive integer n. We compute the sine of x using the series and the computation should use all terms in the series up through the term involving xⁿ

sin x = x - x³/3! + x⁵/5! - x⁷/7! + x⁹/9! + ...

## Task-09

Write a program to compute the cosine of x. The user should supply x and a positive integer n. We compute the cosine of x using the series and the computation should use all terms in the series up through the term involving xⁿ

cos x = 1 - x²/2! + x⁴/4! - x⁶/6! ...
