## Programming Challenges

### Task-05 (Sales Prediction)

The South Punjab sales division of a company generates 62 percent of total sales. Based on that percentage, write a program that will predict how much the South Punjab division will generate if the company has Rs. 680 million in sales this year.

### Task-06 (Restaurant Bill)

Write a program that computes the tax and tip on a restaurant bill for a patron with a Rs. 4450 meal charge. The tax should be 6.75 percent of the meal cost. The tip should be 15 percent of the total after adding the tax. Display the meal cost, tax amount, tip amount, and total bill on the screen.

### Task-07 (Annual Pay)

Suppose an employee gets paid every two weeks and earns Rs. 5700.00 each pay period. In a year the employee gets paid 26 times. Write a program that defines the following variables:

* payAmount: This variable will hold the amount of pay the employee earns each pay period. Initialize the variable with 5700.00.
* payPeriods: This variable will hold the number of pay periods in a year. Initialize the variable with 26.
* annualPay: This variable will hold the employee's total annual pay, which will be calculated.

The program should calculate the employee's total annual pay by multiplying the employee's pay amount by the number of pay periods in a year, and store the result in the annualPay variable. Display the total annual pay on the screen.

### Task-08 (Ocean Level)

Assuming the ocean's level is currently rising at about 1.5 millimeters per year, write a program that displays:

* The number of millimeters higher than the current level that the ocean's level will be in 5 years
* The number of millimeters higher than the current level that the ocean's level will be in 7 years
* The number of millimeters higher than the current level that the ocean's level will be in 10 years

### Task-09 (Land Calculation)

One acre of land is equivalent to 43,560 square feet. Write a program that calculates the number of acres in the tract of land with 389,767 square feet.

### Task-10 (Stock Commission)

Kathryn bought 600 shares of stock at a price of Rs. 21.77 per share. She must pay her stock broker a 2 percent commission for the transaction. Write a program that calculates and displays the following:

* The amount paid for the stock alone (without the commission)
* The amount of the commission
* The total amount paid (for the stock plus the commission)

### Task-11 (Energy Drink Consumption)

A soft drink company recently surveyed 12,467 of its customers and found that approximately 14 percent of those surveyed purchase one or more energy drinks per week. Of those customers who purchase energy drinks, approximately 64 percent of them prefer citrus flavored energy drinks. Write a program that displays the following:

* The approximate number of customers in the survey who purchase one or more energy drinks per week
* The approximate number of customers in the survey who prefer citrus flavored energy drinks
