## Submission Guidelines

1. **Folder Structure**:
    - Each assessment should have its own folder.
    - Each task within an assessment should have its own file.

    Example:
    ```
    assessment-1
        task1.js
        task2.js
    assessment-2
        task1.js
        task2.js
    ```

2. **File Naming**:
    - Name your files according to the task number (e.g., `task1.js`, `task2.js`).

3. **Commit and Push**:
    - Commit your changes with a meaningful message.
    - Push your changes to the GitHub repository.

4. **Share Link**:
    - Share the link to your assessment solution once done.

**Good Luck!**
